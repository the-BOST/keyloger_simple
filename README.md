**Keylogger Simple**

### Description :
This is a simple keylogger script written in Python. It logs keystrokes and clipboard contents into a text file named `txt.txt`. The script runs in the background and starts automatically on system boot.

### Features :

- **Logging Key Strokes:** Records the keys pressed into the text file.
- **Logging Clipboard Contents:** Records the copied content into the text file.
- **Hotkeys for Special Actions:** The `Ctrl + V` key combination triggers the clipboard logging function, and the `Escape + !` combination closes the program.
- **Detection of Specific Key Combinations:** The `$` and `*` key combination opens the text file where logs are saved.

### Installation :

1. **Prerequisites :**
   - Python 3.x installed on the system.
   - Pip installed along with Python.
   - Internet access to install dependencies.

2. **Installation of Dependencies :**
   - Open a command prompt.

### Usage :
